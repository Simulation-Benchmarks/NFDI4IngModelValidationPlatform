The platform uses a hierarchical workflow system that incorporates:

- Multiple simulation tools (e.g., FEniCS, Kratos) for solving a problem.
- Standardized I/O streams to the simulation tools.
- Multiple parameter configurations per benchmark.
- Automated mesh generation.
- Provenance reports generation.
- Querying the research objects.

# Workflow

The workflow has a hierarchical structure. The common tasks like mesh generation and results' summary creation are done by the top-level workflow. The top-level workflow interacts with the sub-workflows which are tool-specific. The sub-workflows are responsible for running the scripts containing simulation code and pre/post-processing scripts necessary for processing the mesh files or the simulation output. 

The benchmark `linear-elastic-plate-with-hole` is implemented with nextflow and snakemake packages. For this benchmark, the structure of the snakemake workflow is exemplified below:

```shell
linear-elastic-plate-with-hole/Snakefile 
│                                  ├── executes ──> create_mesh.py
│                                  └── executes ──> summarize_results.py                       
│
├── calls ──> fenics/Snakefile 
│                       └── executes ──> run_fenics_simulation.py
│
└── calls ──> kratos/Snakefile 
                        ├── executes ──> msh_to_mdpa.py
                        ├── executes ──> create_kratos_input.py
                        ├── executes ──> run_kratos_simulation.py
                        └── executes ──> postprocess_results.py
```

## Terminologies

### Parameter JSON File

A `parameter_*.json` file defines all the user-adjustable parameters for mesh generation, material properties, boundary conditions, and solver settings for finite element simulations. Each parameter file represents a unique configuration of these parameters that will be processed by the workflow system, e.g. [parameter_1.json](https://github.com/BAMresearch/NFDI4IngModelValidationPlatform/blob/main/benchmarks/linear-elastic-plate-with-hole/parameters_1.json).

```json
{   
    "configuration": "1",    
}
```

The keyword `"configuration"` is a unique identifier for the provided parameter set. It is used in output file naming and workflow tracking and must be unique across all parameter files.

### Configuration Generator

`generate_config.py` file writes a configuration file for the workflow managers (snakemake or nextflow) extracting the configuration information from `parameter_*.json` files. Further, it lists the simulation tools that are going to run the different parameter configurations, e.g. [generate_config.py](https://github.com/BAMresearch/NFDI4IngModelValidationPlatform/blob/main/benchmarks/linear-elastic-plate-with-hole/generate_config.py).

### Mesh Generation

The `create_mesh.py` file contains the code for mesh generation. In case the mesh(es) are already available, the file is not needed. In the `linear-elastic-plate-with-hole` example the [create_mesh.py](https://github.com/BAMresearch/NFDI4IngModelValidationPlatform/blob/main/benchmarks/linear-elastic-plate-with-hole/create_mesh.py) file:

1. receives inputs from `\parameter_*.json` and outputs `.msh` files.
2. Uses `gmsh` library for mesh generation.
3. Uses `pint` library for unit conversion to the SI units.

### Summarize File

`summarize_results.py` creates a JSON file containing the solution metrics and their corresponding parameter configurations after simulation runs of a benchmark.

### Environment Files

The environment files are YML files which configures the environment for running a script. They contain a list of software libraries that build up an environment. They are present inside the simulation tool's folder for the tool-specific scripts and inside the benchmark folder for common scripts.
```shell
